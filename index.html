    <h2>Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence!</h2>

    <h3>What role have you got to play?</h3>

    <img src="hi.png" alt="" width=60%>
    <p>As an AI researcher, I beleive that the common, and recurring, view of the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research is that sentient and intelligent machines are just on the horizon. Machines understand verbal commands, distinguish
        pictures, drive cars and play games better than we do. How much longer can it be before they walk among us? Maybe sooner than we think!</p>

    <h3>How many types of artificial Inttelligence are there?
    </h3>
    <p>There are four types of artificial intelligence namely:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reactive machines</li>
        <li>Limited memory</li>
        <li>Theory of mind</li>
        <li>Self-awareness</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the scope of the assignment, I will not be going deeper into explaining these but you can look them up in the internet at your leisure</p>

    <h3>My AI Projects</h3>
    <p>Over the past few months, I have engaged in several AI projects and i must say they are very engaging and eshustive at the same time. Traing a machine to act like or even better than humanss is not one of the easist jobs out thre but it is surely
        one you will enjoy doing despite the challenges.</p>
